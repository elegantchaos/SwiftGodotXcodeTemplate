# SwiftGodot Xcode Example

This is an example showing how to set up a SwiftGodot project for debugging in Xcode.


The basic strategy is to place three folders at the root of the project:

- the SwiftGodot project containing the Swift code for controlling Godot
- the Xcode project for hosting, running and debugging everything
